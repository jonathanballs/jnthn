-   title: The Stranded
    description: A top down multiplayer zombie shooter built with node, sockets and pixie.js. It's fairly unstable and choppy compared to the more recent games but was possibly the hardest to make due to my inexperience at the time.

    description: A top down multiplayer zombie shooter built with node, sockets and p5.js. Two and half years after our first hackathon, Pedro and I attempted to create a sequel to our original game. It's more stable, faster and more fun to play. A good example of how much we had improved.
